    "text": "Training\n\nTime to connect.\nStart the meeting a few minutes early, allow people to enter, and check the video and audio. Be sure they can listen and see you. Let them know it is ok if they don’t turn on their camera.  Share the document you will be using as shared notes on the chat.\nWhen everyone arrives, share the doc and remember the rules of participation, like the code of conduct and how to use it. Mention a short agenda for the day: “We will see toosl for your role as mentor and logistic about the program”.\n\n\nStart the training\nYou can start with the first exercise: Mentorship Reflection. (you can decide if you want to share the slides with the exercise, the shared doc with the exercise, or no share screen).\n“We will start with an exercise: Mentorship Reflection. Please think of an experience you’ve had as a mentor or being mentored. Use the shared doc to answer the questions next to your name (in alphabetical order).”\nRead the questions aloud and give some more examples on what to think to answer:\n“What went well / what was helpful?” “What was that relationship like? How did it help you? What is one helpful thing your mentor/mentee said/did?”\n“What didn’t work? What you needed, and your mentor/mentee couldn’t help you? or didn’t understand you?”\n“Think of a problem you’d like mentoring on right now.”\n“We will use 10 minutes for this exercise”.\nGive them one-two minutes to write in silence. Then you can read some of the answers aloud or add some comments on the doc in silence. Encourage them to read their classmate’s answers and do comments.\n\n\nMentors roles. Mentorship skills\nYou continue with slide three about the mentors’ roles.\n“What do mentors do? Mentors advise and inspire. How do you do this?. “Recommend resources, readings, training, experiences. Feedback to consider.” “Connect to people, programs, and organizations”\nYou should give examples of each activity related to the type of project they will be mentoring. On slide four, you summarise the mentorship skills we will see today:\n“Active Listening, Effective Questioning, Giving Feedback”\nShow slide five now about active listening. Before showing some bullets point, you start with a question:\n“Please, answer on the chat or unmute yourself and answer: What is active listening? How active listening looks like?”\nGive them time to think and share. Read aloud the chat if someone shares in writing form. Iterate on what they said. They will be able to mention helpful information you can note when you show the bullet point about active listening. For example, someone can share that active listening is when people ask good and insightful questions. Or when they pay attention to you (they aren’t watching their phone or answering their email).\nNow follows with slide six about effective questioning. Before showing effective questioning concepts and tips, make the questions:\nWhy questions are important in mentoring? What kind of questions are helpful?. Please, answer on the chat or unmute yourself and answer\nGive them time to think and share. Read aloud the chat if someone shares in writing form. Give priority to the people that don’t participate in the previous question. Iterate on what they said. Use their answer when sharing the bullets point on the slide.\nAs the final part of this section, you go to slide seven about giving feedback. Here we have two prompt questions:\n“What happens if you only give positive feedback? As we did previously, please share your thoughts in the chat or by speaking up.”\nAfter two or three of them share their thoughts, you can ask the second question:\n“What happens if we provide only negative feedback?”\nGive them time to think and share. Read aloud the chat if someone shares in writing form.\nNow show the cartoon about feedback and the bullets point on the slide. One more time use their answer to give examples or support this points. Mention that:\n“Feedback can be the way you provide advice. It also allows everyone to grow.”\n“The source material for good feedback is built on the above two skills, active listening and effective questioning.”\nThe following slide (number 8) present Meetings.\nMeetings are one of the places where mentoring will happen and where mentors will use the skill we mention.\nMention we create templates for meeting as scalfolding for their mentorship task. And then introduce the GROW model.\n\n\nMentor tools. GROW Model.\nUse slides nine and ten to introduce the model and then you do the second exercise.\n“You will work in groups for the next exercise. You will have 10 minutes to watch the video linked in the shared doc. It is an example using the GROW model. The idea is you try to identify the steps of the model. You can re-watch the video or stop, answer, and then continue. Please use the shared doc on your group space to write your questions.\n“When you finish, we will discuss your answer with the whole group.”\nYou can create random groups, with no more than 3-4 people in each group. Read their answer during the exercise and choose some groups to share with the whole class. Choose this group because they add something interesting or different to the discussion. If you have a few groups, give all of them a chance to share their insight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are traching the 120 minutes version of the trainig it is time of a 5/10 minutes break away from the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Practice GROW model mentoring your classmate\n\n\n\nThis in an extra exercise for the 120 minutes version of the training. You will find the instruction on the 2.b exercise on the shared doc. If you are teaching the 90 minutes trainig, then you should remove the 2.b point on the shared doc.\n\n\n\n\nMentor tools.

The process ensured the quality of their software and facilitated its publication in JOSS, which gave them academic credit. Also, getting the rOpenSci badge as an international organization helped other colleagues take their software products more seriously and as valid research products. Fausti volunteered to review packages in Spanish, and advised other colleagues to send their packages to review because their experience was very good. Fausti learned about the champions program and volunteered to mentor because they can give back to the community. It is also, a way to be trained as a mentor, which is a good skill for their academic role and to increase their contact network.\n\n\nDuring this training and orientation, Fausti will gain mentoring skills (active listening, effective questioning, giving feedback), will receive resources for their mentoring role such as the Mentors Guidelines, Meeting Templates and details of the logistics of the champions program."
