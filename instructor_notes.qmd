## Pre-training

Send a calendar invitation with the link to the meeting and a link to the shared notes.

In the shared notes file add the link to the meeting and the rest of the material (such as slides, videos, etc).

Make a reminder the day before and one hour earlier.


## Training

### Time to connect. 
Start the meeting a few minutes early, allow people to enter, and check the video and audio. Be sure they can listen and see you. Let them know it is ok if they don’t turn on their camera.  Share the document you will be using as shared notes on the chat.

When everyone arrives, share the doc and remember the rules of participation, like the code of conduct and how to use it. Mention a short agenda for the day: _“We will see toosl for your role as mentor and logistic about the program”_. 


### Start the training


You can start with the first exercise: Mentorship Reflection. (you can decide if you want to share the slides with the exercise, the shared doc with the exercise, or no share screen).

_"We will start with an exercise: Mentorship Reflection. Please think of an experience you've had as a mentor or being mentored.  Use the shared doc to answer the questions next to your name (in alphabetical order)."_

Read the questions aloud and give some more examples on what to think to answer:

_“What went well / what was helpful?” “What was that relationship like? How did it help you? What is one helpful thing your mentor/mentee said/did?”_

 _“What didn’t work? What you needed, and your mentor/mentee couldn't help you?  or didn't understand you?”_

_“Think of a problem you’d like mentoring on right now.”_

_“We will use 10 minutes for this exercise”._

Give them one-two minutes to write in silence. Then you can read some of the answers aloud or add some comments on the doc in silence. Encourage them to read their classmate's answers and do comments. 


### Mentors roles. Mentorship skills 

You continue with __slide three__ about the mentors' roles. 

_"What do mentors do? Mentors advise and inspire. How do you do this?._ 
_"Recommend resources, readings, training, experiences. Feedback to consider."_
_"Connect to people, programs, and organizations"_

You should give examples of each activity related to the type of project they will be mentoring.
On __slide four__, you summarise the mentorship skills we will see today: 

_"Active Listening, Effective Questioning, Giving Feedback"_

Show __slide five__ now about active listening. Before showing some bullets point, you start with a question:

_"Please, answer on the chat or unmute yourself and answer: What is active listening? How active listening looks like?"_

Give them time to think and share. Read aloud the chat if someone shares in writing form. Iterate on what they said. They will be able to mention helpful information you can note when you show the bullet point about active listening. For example, someone can share that active listening is when people ask good and insightful questions. Or when they pay attention to you (they aren't watching their phone or answering their email).


Now follows with __slide six__ about effective questioning. Before showing effective questioning concepts and tips, make the questions:

_Why questions are important in mentoring? What kind of questions are helpful?. Please, answer on the chat or unmute yourself and answer_

Give them time to think and share. Read aloud the chat if someone shares in writing form. Give priority to the people that don't participate in the previous question. Iterate on what they said. Use their answer when sharing the bullets point on the slide. 

As the final part of this section, you go to __slide seven__ about giving feedback.  Here we have two prompt questions: 

_"What happens if you only give positive feedback? As we did previously, please share your thoughts in the chat or by speaking up."_

After two or three of them share their thoughts, you can ask the second question:

_"What happens if we provide only negative feedback?"_

Give them time to think and share.  Read aloud the chat if someone shares in writing form.

Now show the cartoon about feedback and the bullets point on the slide. One more time use their answer to give examples or support this points. Mention that:

_"Feedback can be the way you provide advice. It also allows everyone to grow."_ 

_"The source material for good feedback is built on the above two skills, active listening and effective questioning."_ 

The following slide (number 8) present Meetings. 

_Meetings are one of the places where mentoring will happen and where mentors will use the skill we mention._

Mention we create templates for meeting as scalfolding for their mentorship task. And then introduce the GROW model.
